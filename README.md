# JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This application runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## Getting Started

This application randomly generates passwords that meets certain criteria (decided by the user).

### Content based on use case

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

  ### Apart from the use case

  * The user will get an animated snackbar for password generated and error message in case used does not select any option.
  * The user is also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
  * Though desirable that the button to copy the password should not scroll along with the “generated password, in case the said value doesn’t fit the screen, but it does and has been left as it is which will be taken care of in future enhancement.
